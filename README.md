## About This Site

- This site is a React single-page e-commerce web application. It is built with react-router, Firebase Authentication, express js and MongoDB.

- I have added login and registration features. You can register by email password and Google.

- Dark and light mode features are also added to this project. First, the theme will be selected according to the theme of the device, then the user can change it if he/she wants.

- Some routes are protected, if the user is not logged in they can't see them, then he will be asked to log in. After login will lead to that route.

- Experience: I faced a lot of challenges while doing this project because I had to do some things that I had never learned before. However, I was able to gain some experience by doing the project.
